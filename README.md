Abstract

Lung cancer remains a significant health threat, often leading to misdiagnosis due to human error in traditional diagnostic methods. This project aims to enhance lung cancer diagnosis by developing machine learning and deep learning models using the LUNA-16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets. A multi-model approach utilizing Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) will be employed for analyzing lung images and identifying nodules to indicate the presence of cancer, enhancing robustness compared to single-model approaches. Additionally, advanced data preprocessing techniques like median imputation are employed to address the high variability in medical images. Previous research has proven how useful these models are, especially CNNs, which have shown to detect and classify lung nodules with an accuracy of almost 78%. Even with these encouraging outcomes, more development and clinical validation are necessary to guarantee their usefulness. Preliminary results in this project indicate promising advancements, with a precision score of approximately 0.72 and an F1 score of 0.62 achieved during model evaluation. These results demonstrate the potential of the developed models to improve lung cancer diagnosis accuracy and reliability. Future objectives include refining these models, expanding the dataset for more comprehensive testing, and integrating these advanced tools into clinical practice to equip radiologists with reliable, AI-enhanced diagnostic capabilities.
